### Web Application template folder from Pre-Workshop Day 2

If possible, put your HTML, CSS and JavaScript files into the following folders:
- HTML in application/templates
- CSS in application/static/css
- JavaScript in application/static/javascript

This is to help me organise the files.
Of course, I understand it may be selfish of me so you can just ignore this but hopefully you guys can use it.

Thank you.
